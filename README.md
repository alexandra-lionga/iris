# IRIS: Inspiring Radiance, Igniting Smiles

## Overview

IRIS is a platform focused on spreading positivity and uplifiting/inspiring stories. The app will focus on providing postive content to the user while also allowing them to contribute their own stories and news they find.

### Problem Space

In today's world, negativity and division dominates media and online spaces. Many people are looking for ways to stay positive and uplifit their spirits. Our app lets them tap into an ongoing feed of inspiring stories, good news, and motivational quotes to counterbalance the negative stressors of media.

### User Profile

Anyone who is looking for positive content can use the app. It is ideal for users seeking encouragement and a positive online experience. There will be an optional account creation for those who would like to track how many times they have seeked positivity and to save any story/quote they would like to revisit.

Users will be able to navigate and explore a feed of positive content while also contributing their own by submiting their personal stories, experiences and/or recommendations. The users will be able to interact through reaction buttons to express their sentiments towards the posted content. Users can also subscribe to a newsletter to keep them up to day with the website content.
