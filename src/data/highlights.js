      "For as long as I can remember, my Nana’s late neighbor used to make pumpkin bread for his neighbors for the holidays. \n\nMy husband and I moved into our first home a couple months ago and I wanted to pass on the tradition now that we have a home of our own, so I baked some of Gene’s Pumpkin Bread for my immediate 5 neighbors. \n\nOne of them left this on our doorstep this morning, and my heart couldn’t be more full! \n\nHappy Thanksgiving everyone, I hope your life is full of blessings! \n\nSide note: my husband and I were JUST talking about how underrated pecan pie is, it’s his favorite!
